# typedef

Typedef is (will be) a statically typed data serialization and interface definition language with built-in string templating. Its serialiaation protocol emphasizes fast and efficient encoding/decoding with minimal data copying.

**The language is currently in heavy development and should not be used for anything.**
See the [todo list](/docs/todo.md) for progress.
